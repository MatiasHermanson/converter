# converter

code for converter is in src/main.java

This converter will convert from miles to kilometers, celcius and fahrenheit, and pounds to  kilograms. Each conversion is reversable, meaning if you have kilometers 
and want miles then you just enter the number in km and press enter and the answer in miles will display. This is also how the other two conversions work as well.
In order to change the conversion just click on the radio dial you want and it will automatically change. However, when a different conversion is selected it will not 
automatically do the arithmatic the user will have to enter a number and press enter in order to get the correct conversion.
